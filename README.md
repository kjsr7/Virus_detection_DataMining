This group project was done as part of academics under the guidance of Dr. Pavan Kumar Alluri. A mathematical model was developed using the Weka API that has been trained with lakhs of benign and malware executables of windows operating system which required huge RAM. To reduce the RAM usage incremental approach has been used to train the model. Required preprocessing has been done to the executables taking different grams at each time and different Machine Learning Algorithms have been applied. Also, Cuckoo sandbox has been used to measure the deviation from the benign executables. All the comparisons done are mentioned in this project report. The model developed could classify a given executable as a malware or benign with a pretty good amount of accuracy.
